<p>The Norwegian Ministry of Health handles the verification of your medical education.</p>
<p>The first step is to make sure that the medical university you graduated from is recognized by the World Directory of Medical Schools.</p>
<p><img src="../../../img/doctor-in-norway/WDoMS.png" alt="WDoMS"></p>
<p>If everything is OK, then the next step is to submit documents to the American company ECFMG EPIC. They send a request to your university to confirm that you really studied there. After the answer, they send a report to the Helsedirektoratet. This takes about 2 months. At the same time as EPIC evaluate your documents, you can also send them to the Helsedirektoratet. Because there the waiting time is up to 11 months.</p>
<p>Once your education is approved, you will receive a license that allows you to work under the supervision of another doctor. It is valid for 3 years. During this time, you must meet 3 requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass Norskprøven - all 4 parts</li>
<li>Pass Nasjonalfagkurs</li>
<li>Pass Fagprøven</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you get the right to go through L1S. It&rsquo;s like an residence in US.</p>
<p>Each step is described in detail in my other articles.</p>
<p>After obtaining a temporary license, the first job that most doctors who come to Norway from a non-EU country start with is a pleieassistent in a sykehjem (nursing home) in a municipality far from large cities (there is the greatest demand for staff and there are no high requirements). Open vacancies are monitored on the website <a href="https://arbeidsplassen.nav.no/">arbeidsplassen.nav.no</a>. It is recommended to know the language from level B1 for a more or less comfortable level of work in a sykehjem.</p>
<p>To work in a sykehus as an assistant, you need a well-written CV, søknadsbrev and interview practice. Your CV and søknadsbrev are evaluated by the artificial intelligence of the HR department, and you receive a Master Score according to which applications are selected. This is due to the fact that a large number of applications are received for one vacancy. In the future, experience working in a sykehus will be of great importance when applying for L1S.</p>
