*Nesflaten, Norge - Des 2023*

The idea came about because doctors outside of EU/EEA have difficulty understanding the process of confirming medical education in Norway. Many things come only when you go through it yourself. Therefore, on this site you will get information from someone who is going through it.

I try to ensure that the information I provide is accurate, but errors are possible. If you see an error, please report it in Telegram.

The photos used on the site were taken by my wife.

The site is built on HUGO with a custom theme, Tina CMS content manager, GitHub Pages deploy.
