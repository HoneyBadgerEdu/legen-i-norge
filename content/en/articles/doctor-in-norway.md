The Norwegian Ministry of Health handles the verification of your medical education.

The first step is to make sure that the medical university you graduated from is recognized by the World Directory of Medical Schools.

If everything is OK, then the next step is to submit documents to the American company ECFMG EPIC. They send a request to your university to confirm that you really studied there. After the answer, they send a report to the Helsedirektoratet. This takes about 2 months. At the same time as EPIC, you can send documents to the Helsedirektoratet. Because there the waiting time is up to 11 months.

Once your education is approved, you will receive a license that allows you to work under the supervision of another doctor. It is valid for 3 years. During this time, you must meet 3 requirements:

* Pass Norskprøven - all 4 parts
* Pass Nasjonalfagkurs
* Pass Fagprøven

After that, you get the right to go through Turnus. It's like an residence in US.

Each step is described in detail in my other articles.
